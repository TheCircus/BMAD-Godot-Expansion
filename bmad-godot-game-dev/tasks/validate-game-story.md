# Validate Game Story Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate a Godot game development story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it contains all necessary Godot-specific technical context, game development requirements, and implementation details. This specialized validation prevents hallucinations, ensures Godot development readiness, and validates game-specific acceptance criteria and testing approaches.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)
