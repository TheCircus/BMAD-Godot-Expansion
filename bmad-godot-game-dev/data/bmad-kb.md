- **Existing Game Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions, level expansions, and gameplay enhancements
- **Game Team Collaboration**: Multiple specialized roles working together on game features
- **Game Quality Assurance**: Structured testing, performance validation, and gameplay balance
- **Game Documentation**: Professional Game Design Documents, technical architecture, user stories

## How BMad Works for Game Development

### The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Player Experience CEO" - directing a team of specialized game development AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide game vision and creative decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Game Agents**: Each agent masters one game development role (Designer, Developer, Scrum Master)
3. **Game-Focused Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from game concept to deployed Godot game
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective for game development

### The Two-Phase Game Development Approach

#### Phase 1: Game Design & Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

- Use large context windows for comprehensive game design
- Generate complete Game Design Documents and technical architecture
- Leverage multiple agents for creative brainstorming and mechanics refinement
- Create once, use throughout game development

#### Phase 2: Game Development (IDE - Implementation)

- Shard game design documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM → Dev cycles for game features
- One game story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time Godot operations, GDScript coding, and game testing

### The Game Development Loop

```text
1. Game SM Agent (New Chat) → Creates next game story from sharded docs
2. You → Review and approve game story
3. Game Dev Agent (New Chat) → Implements approved game feature in Godot
4. QA Agent (New Chat) → Reviews code and tests gameplay
5. You → Verify game feature completion
6. Repeat until game epic complete
```

### Why This Works for Games

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance for complex game logic
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality game features
- **Incremental Progress**: Small game stories = manageable complexity
- **Player-Focused Oversight**: You validate each game feature = quality control
- **Design-Driven**: Game specs guide everything = consistent player experience

### Core Game Development Philosophy

#### Player-First Development

You are developing games as a "Player Experience CEO" - thinking like a game director with unlimited creative resources and a singular vision for player enjoyment.

#### Game Development Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_PLAYER_ENGAGEMENT**: Push the AI to create compelling gameplay. Challenge mechanics and iterate.
2. **GAMEPLAY_QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of fun. Review all game features.
3. **CREATIVE_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level game vision and ensure design alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit game mechanics. Game development is not linear.
5. **CLEAR_GAME_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise game requirements lead to better implementations.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good game design docs lead to good game features.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test core mechanics, then expand and polish.
8. **EMBRACE_CREATIVE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome game development challenges.

## Getting Started with Game Development

### Quick Start Options for Game Development

#### Option 1: Web UI for Game Design

**Best for**: Game designers who want to start with comprehensive planning

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/` (after building)
2. Copy `godot-game-team.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available game development commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration for Game Development

**Best for**: Godot developers using Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
# Select the bmad-godot-game-dev expansion pack when prompted
```

**Installation Steps for Game Development**:

- Choose "Install expansion pack" when prompted
- Select "bmad-godot-game-dev" from the list
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration with Godot support
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Trae**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support
  - **GitHub Copilot**: VS Code extension with AI peer programming assistant

**Verify Game Development Installation**:

- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all core agents
- `.bmad-godot-game-dev/` folder with game development agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- Game development agents available with `/bmadg` prefix (per config.yaml)

### Environment Selection Guide for Game Development

**Use Web UI for**:

- Game design document creation and brainstorming
- Cost-effective comprehensive game planning (especially with Gemini)
- Multi-agent game design consultation
- Creative ideation and mechanics refinement

**Use IDE for**:

- Godot project development and GDScript coding
- Game asset operations and project integration
- Game story management and implementation workflow
- Godot testing, profiling, and debugging

**Cost-Saving Tip for Game Development**: Create large game design documents in web UI, then copy to `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md` in your Godot project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Game Development Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the game development tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only Game Development**:

- Single environment workflow from design to Godot deployment
- Direct Godot project operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate Godot project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only Game Development**:

- Higher token costs for large game design document creation
- Smaller context windows for comprehensive game planning
- May hit limits during creative brainstorming phases
- Less cost-effective for extensive game design iteration

**CRITICAL RULE for Game Development**:

- **ALWAYS use Game SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Game Dev agent for Godot implementation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: Game SM and Game Dev agents are specifically optimized for Godot workflows
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for design, switch to Game SM → Game Dev for implementation

## Core Configuration for Game Development (core-config.yaml)

**New in V4**: The `expansion-packs/bmad-godot-game-dev/core-config.yaml` file enables BMad to work seamlessly with any Godot project structure, providing maximum flexibility for game development.

### Game Development Configuration

The expansion pack follows the standard BMad configuration patterns. Copy your core-config.yaml file to expansion-packs/bmad-godot-game-dev/ and add Game-specific configurations to your project's `core-config.yaml`:

```yaml

  - docs/game-architecture/3-tech-stack.md
  - docs/game-architecture/8-godot-project-structure.md
```

## Complete Game Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended - Especially Gemini for Game Design!)

**Ideal for cost efficiency with Gemini's massive context for game brainstorming:**

**For All Game Projects**:

1. **Game Concept Brainstorming**: `/bmadg/game-designer` - Use `*game-design-brainstorming` task
2. **Game Brief**: Create foundation game document using `game-brief-tmpl`
3. **Game Design Document Creation**: `/bmadg/game-designer` - Use `game-design-doc-tmpl` for comprehensive game requirements
4. **Game Architecture Design**: `/bmadg/game-architect` - Use `game-architecture-tmpl` for Godot technical foundation
5. **Level Design Framework**: `/bmadg/game-designer` - Use `level-design-doc-tmpl` for level structure planning
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to Godot project as `docs/game-design-doc.md`, `docs/game-brief.md`, `docs/level-design.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md`

#### Example Game Planning Prompts

**For Game Design Document Creation**:

```text
"I want to build a [genre] game that [core gameplay].
Help me brainstorm mechanics and create a comprehensive Game Design Document."
```

**For Game Architecture Design**:

```text
"Based on this Game Design Document, design a scalable Godot architecture
that can handle [specific game requirements] with stable performance."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to Godot IDE

**Once game planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for Godot development:**

- **Why**: Godot development workflow requires GDScript operations, asset management, and real-time Godot testing
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large game design creation; IDE is optimized for Godot development
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md` exist in your Godot project

### Godot IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Game planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder of Godot project

1. **Document Sharding** (CRITICAL STEP for Game Development):

   - Documents created by Game Designer/Architect (in Web or IDE) MUST be sharded for development
   - Use core BMad agents or tools to shard:
     a) **Manual**: Use core BMad `shard-doc` task if available
     b) **Agent**: Ask core `@bmad-master` agent to shard documents
   - Shards `docs/game-design-doc.md` → `docs/game-design/` folder
   - Shards `docs/game-architecture.md` → `docs/game-architecture/` folder
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT shard in Web UI - copying many small files to Godot is painful!

2. **Verify Sharded Game Content**:
   - At least one `feature-n.md` file in `docs/game-design/` with game stories in development order
   - Godot system documents and coding standards for game dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for Game SM agent story creation

Resulting Godot Project Folder Structure:

- `docs/game-design/` - Broken down game design sections
- `docs/game-architecture/` - Broken down Godot architecture sections
- `docs/game-stories/` - Generated game development stories

3. **Game Development Cycle** (Sequential, one game story at a time):

   **CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT for Godot Development**:

   - **Context windows matter!** Always use fresh, clean context windows
   - **Model selection matters!** Use most powerful thinking model for Game SM story creation
   - **ALWAYS start new chat between Game SM, Game Dev, and QA work**

   **Step 1 - Game Story Creation**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → Select powerful model → `/bmadg/game-sm` → `*draft`
   - Game SM executes create-game-story task using `game-story-tmpl`
   - Review generated story in `docs/game-stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"

   **Step 2 - Godot Game Story Implementation**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → `/bmadg/game-developer`
   - Agent asks which game story to implement
   - Include story file content to save game dev agent lookup time
   - Game Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Game Dev maintains File List of all Godot/GDScript changes
   - Game Dev marks story as "Review" when complete with all Godot tests passing

   **Step 3 - Game QA Review**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → Use core `@qa` agent → execute review-story task
   - QA performs senior Godot developer code review
   - QA can refactor and improve Godot code directly
   - QA appends results to story's QA Results section
   - If approved: Status → "Done"
   - If changes needed: Status stays "Review" with unchecked items for game dev

   **Step 4 - Repeat**: Continue Game SM → Game Dev → QA cycle until all game feature stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 game story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all game feature stories complete.

### Game Story Status Tracking Workflow

Game stories progress through defined statuses:

- **Draft** → **Approved** → **InProgress** → **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Game Development Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Game Development

- Game concept brainstorming and mechanics design
- Game design requirements and feature definition
- Godot system architecture and technical design
- Game development execution
- Game testing, performance optimization, and deployment

#### Brownfield Game Enhancement (Existing Godot Projects)

**Key Concept**: Brownfield game development requires comprehensive documentation of your existing Godot project for AI agents to understand game mechanics, Godot patterns, and technical constraints.

**Brownfield Game Enhancement Workflow**:

Since this expansion pack doesn't include specific brownfield templates, you'll adapt the existing templates:

1. **Upload Godot project to Web UI** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Create adapted Game Design Document**: `/bmadg/game-designer` - Modify `game-design-doc-tmpl` to include:

   - Analysis of existing game systems
   - Integration points for new features
   - Compatibility requirements
   - Risk assessment for changes

3. **Game Architecture Planning**:

   - Use `/bmadg/game-architect` with `game-architecture-tmpl`
   - Focus on how new features integrate with existing Godot systems
   - Plan for gradual rollout and testing

4. **Story Creation for Enhancements**:
   - Use `/bmadg/game-sm` with `*create-game-story`
   - Stories should explicitly reference existing code to modify
   - Include integration testing requirements

**When to Use Each Game Development Approach**:

**Full Game Enhancement Workflow** (Recommended for):

- Major game feature additions
- Game system modernization
- Complex Godot integrations
- Multiple related gameplay changes

**Quick Story Creation** (Use when):

- Single, focused game enhancement
- Isolated gameplay fixes
- Small feature additions
- Well-documented existing Godot game

**Critical Success Factors for Game Development**:

1. **Game Documentation First**: Always document existing code thoroughly before making changes
2. **Godot Context Matters**: Provide agents access to relevant Godot scripts and game systems
3. **Gameplay Integration Focus**: Emphasize compatibility and non-breaking changes to game mechanics
4. **Incremental Approach**: Plan for gradual rollout and extensive game testing

## Document Creation Best Practices for Game Development

### Required File Naming for Game Framework Integration

- `docs/game-design-doc.md` - Game Design Document
- `docs/game-architecture.md` - Godot System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter for Game Development**:

- Game agents automatically reference these files during Godot development
- Game sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Game workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Game Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Game Documents (Game Design Document, Game Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create game documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your Godot project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md`
4. **Switch to Godot IDE**: Use IDE agents for Godot development and smaller game documents

### Game Document Sharding

Game templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original Game Design Document**:

```markdown
## Core Gameplay Mechanics

## Player Progression System

## Level Design Framework

## Technical Requirements
```

**After Sharding**:

- `docs/game-design/core-gameplay-mechanics.md`
- `docs/game-design/player-progression-system.md`
- `docs/game-design/level-design-framework.md`
- `docs/game-design/technical-requirements.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic game document sharding.

## Game Agent System

### Core Game Development Team

| Agent            | Role              | Primary Functions                           | When to Use                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `game-designer`  | Game Designer     | Game mechanics, creative design, GDD          | Game concept, mechanics, creative direction  |
| `game-developer` | Godot Developer   | GDScript implementation, Godot optimization   | All Godot development tasks                  |
| `game-sm`        | Game Scrum Master | Game story creation, sprint planning          | Game project management, workflow            |
| `game-architect` | Game Architect    | Godot system design, technical architecture   | Complex Godot systems, performance planning |

**Note**: For QA and other roles, use the core BMad agents (e.g., `@qa` from bmad-core).

### Game Agent Interaction Commands
